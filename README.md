# H&M-Product-Recommendations
> Product recommendations based on data from previous transactions, as well as from customer and product meta data

## Background

## Problem

## Data

## Models
Four different algorithms were implemented: Naive method, content-based filtering, collaboriative filtering, and hybrid method. Naive method is to use the top ten most popular products across all customers and recommending those to everyone. While the content-based filtering uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, collaborative filtering is solely based on the past interactions that have been recorded between users and items, in order to produce new recommendations. Lastly, for naive hybrid recommender system, we extracted top 5 recommendations from the each model we developed previously, and combined them. 

## Results

## Repo Structure
The repo is structured as follows: Notebooks are grouped according to their series (e.g., 10, 20), which reflects the general task to be performed in those notebooks. Start with theh *0 notebook in the series and add other investigations relevant to the task in the series (e.g., `21-content-based-filtering`). 

1* is related to data processing. 2* is about modeling: naive method, content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid method.
